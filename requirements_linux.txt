// This script is a self-made sample with lots of experimentation and
// researches to be submitted as part of assignment in Recep Tayyip
// Erdogan University, Computer Engineering Department. It is designed
// to do as the requested assignment does and emails them to
// windowz414@1337.lgbt as proof. Check relevant platform's
// requirements.txt file for more info about dependencies and
// compatibility. This assignment will stay FOSS (Free and Open Source
// Software) and be provided in "AS IS" basis without any guarantees.
// Any kinds of contribution, such as forks, PRs, Issues, are welcome
// as long as it has the intention of constructive critisism or actual
// contribution to source code. This piece of code, in no way, reflects
// any of my plans for current and future projects and is meant solely
// as a homework/assignment.

// This text file provides requirements for when you run the GNU/Linux
// shell script. One of them being unmet means you might face unknown
// issues, although we work hard to reduce dependencies to only the
// ones provided in all GNU/Linux distributions would ship as of
// the date of code.
